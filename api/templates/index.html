<p>Would you like some Lorem ipsum? Would you like it to be created by mashing 
together paragraphs taken at random from mediocre tech and finance articles? 
You&rsquo;ve come to the right place. You can view generated output below or 
use it to create your own articles by accessing this <a href="json">JSON 
endpoint</a>. This can be iterated through with some vanilla JavaScript as provided for on this <a href="https://lennon.dev/reader.html">reference 
implementation</a> page. <a href="https://github.com/kirklennon/Clickbait">The 
code for this project is on GitHub</a>.
  <p>I have collected the following real clickbait content:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Paragraphs:</strong> {{ num_para }}</li>
    <li><strong>Source Articles:</strong> {{ num_source }}</li>
  </ul>
 <h3>A randomly generated article:</h3>
  {% if paragraph_list %}

    {% for para in paragraph_list %}
      <p>{{ para.text }}</p>
    {% endfor %}

  {% else %}
    <p>No paragraphs were found</p>
  {% endif %}
